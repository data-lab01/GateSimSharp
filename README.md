# GateSim#

**GateSim#** is a lightweight educational quantum circuit simulator built with C# and Blazor. It allows users to visually design simple quantum circuits and simulate how quantum gates (like Hadamard, Pauli-X, and CNOT) affect qubit states.

## 🚀 Features
- Drag-and-drop quantum gate builder
- Simulate quantum state evolution
- Basic qubit visualizations
- Pure C# linear algebra (no QDK required)

## 🧠 Ideal For
- Students learning quantum computing
- Developers prototyping circuits
- Educators demonstrating superposition & entanglement

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- .NET 8
- Blazor WebAssembly
- C# (no Q# required)

## 📦 Run It
```bash
dotnet run
```
